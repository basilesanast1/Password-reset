Step 2:
Paste this code: net user myuser newpass
(replace "myuser" with your username and "newpass" with the password you would like to use)

Step 3:
Save the file. Click: File, save as... and choose all files in the file type window. Name it: arandomname.bat
(placing .bat at the end of the name IS A MUST)
